This Assessment has 20 Statements, and each of the Statements come with 4 probable responses, given a chance, that you may like to provide.  The responses are indicated as Options i, ii, iii and iv.

You are given FOUR points to credit to the Responses that you aremost likely to provide.  All you need to do is to distribute the four points among the responses that most appeal to you.

If you are certain that your likely response to a Statement is only one of the four options, you would give all the four points to that option, and zero points to the other three.

If you think that you may like to respond in two of the four ways, you can either award points like 3 and 1 or even 2 and 2 to those two options.You award a higher point to the option that appears closer to your liking.  The other two options may be awarded zero points each.  

If you think that you may like to respond in three of the four ways, you can either award points like 2, 1, 1, or 1, 2, 1 or 1, 1, 2, to the three responses.  You award a higher point to the option that appears closer to your liking.  The fourth option may be awarded zero point.

In an unlikely situation where you feel that all the four options are likely to come from you, you may give 1 point to each of the four options.

It is very important that the total of the points you award to each statement should come to 4.  It should neither be less than or more than 4.

We welcome you believe that there are no right or wrong options.  Every option is considered as right.  Please do not get into deep analysis of each of the options in order to pick the best ones.  After understanding the question, trust on your instincts in picking your choices.

All the Best!
